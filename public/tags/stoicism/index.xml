      <description>I have been interested in Stoic philosophy for a while and decided to do some reading to understand more. What I have found in a short time is that although Stocicism is literally an ancient philosophy, it has never been more relevant than today. In the modern world of the 21st century, with it&amp;rsquo;s stressors and challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s guiding principles assist us in not only understanding what to do in every situation but how we should react.</description>
