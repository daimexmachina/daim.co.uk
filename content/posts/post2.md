This bike is my pride and joy. It doesn't get out nearly as much as it should do. It's a 2020 Trek Full Stache and the only original parts left on it from new are the bottom bracket and headset. It has a set of custom built wheels using Raceface ARC Offset 40 rims, laced to purple Industry Nine Hydra hubs using black Sapim cx-ray spokes and purple alloy nipples. The drivetrain is full SRAM X01 with a 10-50 cassette. The brakes are SRAM Code RSC on 203mm front and 180mm rear rotors. It has a PNW Loam dropper post attached to an SQLab 60X saddle. The cockpit is Deity carbon bars attached with purple Industry Nine stem and a Wolf Tooth light-action dropper lever. The grips are Ergon GE EVO. The suspension was also fully updated from stock with a Fox Float DPX Factory shock and a set of 150mm/44mm offset Rockshox Pike Ultimate forks up front. Being a Full Stache it's capable of running 29x3.0 tires and that's exactly what it is shod with. a Maxxis DHF in front and a DHR II at the rear. Massive rubber for massive fun.
