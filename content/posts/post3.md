I believe that Stocicism has never been more relevant than today. It's guiding principles assist us in not only understanding what to do in every situation but how we should react.  

I'm no expert in the philosophy, but the simple guiding phrases and virtues below, I find particularly inspiring and aspirational.  

{{< figure src="/images/marcus_aurelius.jpg" title="Marcus Aurelius" caption="Who wrote extensively in his meditations about Stoicism." >}}

### Guiding Principles:

- **Memento Mori** - "Remember that you may have no time left"
- **Amor Fati** - "Learn to love and embrace change and the unexpected"
- **Premeditatio Malorum** - "Visualize potential future grief and hardship and plan accordingly"
- **Summum Bonum** - "Always do the right thing, the most good."
- **Sympatheia** - "Always act in the interests of the common good"

### The Four Stoic Virtues:
- **Justice** 
- **Temperance** 
- **Wisdom** 
- **Courage**
